<h1>DISCRIPTION</h1>-<br />
During the global covid-19, the whole country was shut down and people were asked to stay at their homes. During the early days due to lack of information people panicked. This was the major inspiration for this fun project, our government already provided covid-19 related data as API and website, the application made it easy and feasible for common people to get the right data.

OUTCOME-<br />
This is a cross-platform mobile application that uses global covid-19 data API to display covid-19 cases around you and in your city and locality, depending upon the data received it can predict how many precautions one must take and how much an area is prone to infection. The app collected basic personal data that was used to display precautions one must take according to the age group they belong to.  The application also took covid-19 related data from the national health website and displayed it with reference. The application was capable of fetching custom queries to the google news website. All the features in this application were divided into pages that can be navigated through an icon based menu.
