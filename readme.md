During the global covid-19, the whole country was shut down and people were asked to stay at their homes. During the early days due to lack of information people panicked. This was the major inspiration for this fun project, our government already provided covid-19 related data as API and website, the application made it easy and feasible for common people to get the right data. While making this project I learned about REST API, JSON data, and advanced javascript also I learned React Native as a cross platform development tool. I got to learn many things like managing data in an application, circulation of data, pages, the lifecycle of pages, authentication management, and much more. It was a fun journey making this project as this project was made when my country INDIA didn't have a covid-19 tracking application. It worked well for family and peers and was informative and useful for its time. This project taught me cross-platform application development and API use also helped me enhance my javascript knowledge. Making this code helped me understand application design and what people like in an application and how to design it so people can use it easily and interpret it correctly.

This is a cross-platform mobile application that uses global covid-19 data API to display covid-19 cases around you and in your city and locality, depending upon the data received it can predict how many precautions one must take and how much an area is prone to infection. The app collected basic personal data that was used to display precautions one must take according to the age group they belong to.  The application also took covid-19 related data from the national health website and displayed it with reference. The application was capable of fetching custom queries to the google news website. All the features in this application were divided into pages that can be navigated through an icon based menu.  The clean application needed a one-time login with an offline database and would remember login thereafter. Every data was collected by the government website, national covid-19 data API, and google news. The application was made with react native as a development tool and javascript as the primary development language. Data used by the application was minimal images and graphs provided by the website were loaded in the app page environment that can be navigated with the help of a menu at the bottom.
